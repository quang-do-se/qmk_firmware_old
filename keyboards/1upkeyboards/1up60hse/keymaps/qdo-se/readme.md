# 1up60hse default keymap generated by QMK Configurator

This is the keymap used by [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/1upkeyboards/1up60hse/LAYOUT_60_ansi) as default.

# Flash

`qmk compile -kb 1upkeyboards/1up60hse -km qdo-se && qmk flash -kb 1upkeyboards/1up60hse -km qdo-se`

# Notes

Don't use `add_mods(MOD_RCTL);`. It sends both left control and right control for some unknown reasons.

Use:

- `register_code(KC_RCTL)`
- `add_mods(MOD_BIT(KC_RCTL));`
- `register_mods(MOD_BIT(KC_RCTRL));`

We have to handle the release for right control if the right control is not pressed.

# Debug

Download `hid_listen` at https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/hid_listen.html

# Layout

Hit `Fn + Alt + [ESC(0) or 1(1) or 2(2)]` to switch layout

`Fn` will always switch to layer 1 temporarily.

When `Fn` is released, it reverses back to the previous layout.

If layout is changed during `Fn` is pressed, releasing `Fn` will do nothing.
